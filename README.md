## üôè Acknowledgement

Special thanks to **Professor Shiyu Zhao** for his insightful course on *‚ÄúMathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning‚Äù*, which laid a solid theoretical and practical foundation for my understanding of reinforcement learning. The comprehensive course materials ‚Äî including the textbook, lecture slides, and sample code ‚Äî are publicly available on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MathFoundationRL/Book-Mathematical-Foundation-of-Reinforcement-Learning.git). In addition, both English and Chinese versions of the lecture videos are accessible online, offering valuable learning resources for a broader audience.

Special thanks to [Autolabor](http://www.autolabor.com.cn/) for providing the excellent online tutorial **ROS Tutorials** ([link](http://www.autolabor.com.cn/book/ROSTutorials/index.html)), which offers a clear and practical introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS). The tutorial serves as a valuable learning resource for beginners and practitioners alike, covering essential concepts with hands-on examples.

Gratitude is also extended to the authors of the **Practical PyTorch** [(GitHub repository)](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch.git), which offers a collection of well-structured and easy-to-follow PyTorch code examples. These implementations greatly facilitated my understanding of deep learning and PyTorch programming in practice.
