This repository contains a simplified implementation of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model architecture, primarily designed to demonstrate ViT's core structure and key components. Please note that this is example code - it does not include complete training procedures or data preprocessing, and cannot be run directly.

For complete implementations, please refer to:
